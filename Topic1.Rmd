## Psychosocial Theory (Erikson)

- 8 stages of development from birth to adulthood.

- All stages in a specific order, containing a crisis at each stage. needing resolution before the next stage.

- Failure to resolve the crisis at each stage would effect child's development at late stages.


| Developmental Stage              | Developmental Crisis           | Description of Crisis |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |-----------------------|
| Birth - 1 year                   | Trust Vs Mistrust              | Development of trust as a consequence of treatment. |
| 1 - 3 years                      | Autonomy vs Shame              | Learning to negotiate with parents to have needs and wants met. Development of a sense of independence. |
| 3 - 6 years                      | Initiative vs Guilt            | Learning how to play with others, lead and follow, as opposed to prevention from joining in through guilt or fear. |
| 6 years to adolescence           | Industry vs Inferiority        | Building of skills around play and obeying rules. Mastery of social skills, and self discipline. A mistrusting child will develop defeat and inferiority. |
| Adolescence (10 - 20 years)      | Identity vs Identity Diffusion | Children experiment with defiance and rule breaking. Also the time when a child will develop their sense of self and identity. |
| Young Adulthood (20 - 40 years)  | Intimacy vs Isolation          | A period of building long standing friendships and relationships. |
| Middle Adulthood (40 - 60 years) | Gernerativity vs Stagnation    | Becoming productive in society and setting an example for future generations. Developing interest in parenthood. |
| Old Age (60+ years)              | Integrity vs Despair           | Acknowledgement of prior achievement of the other stages and the recognition of integrity, as opposed to despair should one or more of the crises at previous stages not be resolved. |

### Evaluation of Psychosocial Theory

- While insightful and plausible, no empirical evidence was gathered to develop theory.
- Erikson worked mainly with children, so his theory was based on this experience.
- The teen crisis was used to refer to the sensitivity of developmental meds at each stage, rather than a catastrophic event.
- Emphasises the role of psycological and social influence a development throughout a lifetime.

## Behaviourism

### Core Concepts:

1. The Blank Slate: Children enter the world as a blank slate with ability to learn based on their
	environment.

2. Behavioural Focus: Concentrates on observable behaviours, and discovery of environmental stimuli responsible.

3. Environmental Determinism: A individuals behaviour is shaped by their environment rather than 'free will'.

4. Conditioning: The main process through which we learn.

Pavlov's dogs: Classical Conditioning

Operant Conditioning (Skinner's pigeons)

Social Modelling or Social learning theory (Bandura)

Observation (of consequences), imitation, and modelling as demonstrated via the Bobo doll experiment (modelling and imitation of aggression). The experiment found that observations of aggressive behaviour influenced children towards acceptance (TAC ad).

Behavioural (learning)Theories

Identified by many as being relevant regardless of age, and not being isolated to a particular "stage". The focus instead, is on stimulus/response and looking for predictable patterns of behaviour.

Behaviourism (Watson)

**Evaluation of behavioural theories**

- Empirical approach (Bobo experiment)
- Attempts to demonstrate cause and effect
- Neglects rational thought processes.
- Does not address behaviours that are present in the absence of conditioning.
- Demonstration of hostile more likely to develop a hostile bias in future interactions.
- Some suggest that the setting is artificial. Demonstrating behaviours that were thought to be expected.
- Fails to determine if behaviours would be generalised in other scenarios.
- Primary focus on environmental factors, ignoring genetic disposition, sex based neurological differences.

### Ethological Theory


**Evaluation of Ethological Theory**


### Ecological Theory

Stresses that behaviour is strongly influenced by biology and evolution while also being mediated by sensitive periods. Emotions and thinking is heavily influenced by inherited factors.

Charles Darwin's theory of evolution underpins this theory, stating that more than just physical attributes (hair and eye colour) influence us.

**Environment**

Cognitive development theories

- Sociocultural Theory Development (Vygotsky)
- Info processing approach (Siegler)
