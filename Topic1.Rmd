Some of the key developmental theories serve to try and explain or understand the complex processes of childhood development. Some of the key theories are:

### Psychodynamic Theory (Freud)
### Psychosocial Theory (Erik Erikson)
### Behaviourism and social learning theory
  + *'Blank Slate'*
  + *The behavioural focus*
  + *Environmentalist Determinism*
  + *Conditioning*
  
### Ethological theory
  + *Emphasis of behaviour in normal contexts. Key developmental concepts are 'imprinting' and the 'critical period'*

###  The bioecological theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1979)
  + *Microsystem*
  + *Mesosystem*
  + *Exosystem*
  + *Macrosystem*

### Life course theory (Elder, 1995, 1998)
  + *Human lives are situated in historical time and place*
  + *Developmental studies must pay attention to the time of our lives*
  + *Human lives are interdependent or linked with each other*
  + *Human beings have the ability to make decisions and power to change their lives*

### Cognitive development theories
  + *Cognitive Development Theory (Piaget, 1983)*
  + *Vygotsky's Sociocultural theory development (Vygotsky, 1978, 1986)*
  + *The information processing approach (Siegler, 1996)*

### Explain how Erikson’s Psychosocial theory uses crises to progress through stages (chapter 2)

The outline of Erikson's developmental stages is below:

| Developmental Stage              | Developmental Crisis           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Birth - 1 year                   | Trust Vs Mistrust              |
| 1 - 3 years                      | Autonomy vs Shame              |
| 3 - 6 years                      | Initiative vs Guilt            |
| 6 years to adolescence           | Industry vs Inferiority        |
| Adolescence (10 - 20 years)      | Identity vs Identity Diffusion |
| Young Adulthood (20 - 40 years)  | Intimacy vs Isolation          |
| Middle Adulthood (40 - 60 years) | Gernerativity vs Stagnation    |
| Old Age (60+ years)              | Integrity vs Despair           |

Erikson's theory encompassed both internal psychological factors and external social factors

Each of the 8 stages appeared in order and built upon each other. A specific challenge or crisis was prevalent at each stage, requiring resolution in order to progress to the next stage. A failure to resolve each crisis lead to a negative impact in the resolution of crises at later stages.
