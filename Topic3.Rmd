### LO1: Consider how the three D’s inform our understanding of what is ‘abnormal’, and outline the diagnostic manuals used to classify and categorise psychological disorders.

#### What is abnormal?

Abnormal behaviour is behaviour that is personally distressing, personally dysfunctional, and/or so culturally deviant that other people judge it to be inappropriate or distressing.

#### The 3Ds of Abnormality 

Distressing - to the individuals and/or people around them.
Dysfunctional - to the individual and/or society in some way.
Deviant - Significantly differs from societal norms and/or is out of situational context.

For example, homosexuality was considered abnormal behaviour and outside of societal norms until 1973, and was subsequently removed from the DSM in 1987.

#### Diagnostic Manuals

<span>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)</span>

  -   Main publication manual
  -   Revised every 2 - 3 years
  -   Most commonly used within Australia
  -   Published (and updated) by the American Psychological Association

<span>International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD10)</span>

  -   Published by World Health Organisation

### LO2: Describe the vulnerability-stress model and how it assists in explaining the development of behavioural disorders.

#### The Vulnerability-Stress Model

-   Also known as the <span>Diathesis-Stress Model</span>
-   The culmination of vulnerability (<span>predisposing</span> factors) and stress (<span>precipitating</span> factors) that lead to a Mental Health Disorder.
-   As described in the "Stress Bucket" video
-   The bucket represents our capacity to cope with stress
-   The events in our life add or remove water from the bucket

### LO3: Understand the key characteristics of the anxiety and related disorders, and explain the underlying causal factors.

#### Anxiety and Related Disorders

Are characterised by a subjective experience of fear and worry, physiological arousal, and a behavioural tendency to escape or avoid a feared situation

#### What Makes It Abnormal?

<span>Anxiety</span> - A natural response to a perceived threat.

<span>Anxiety Disorder</span> - The intensity or frequency of an individual's anxiety response that is out of proportion to the situation.

Anxiety itself stems from an evolutionary perspective and the potential threat to our safety from our environment (e.g. animals), however, observable changes to our society have altered the nature and frequency of external threats.

#### Anxiety Disorder Examples

-   Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
-   Generalised Anxiety Disorder
-   Panic Disorder
-   Social Anxiety Disorder
-   Specific Phobias

#### Generalised Anxiety Disorder

-   Chronic state of diffuse anxiety that is not attached to specific situations or objects.
-   Lasting at least 6 months.

#### Phobias

-   Strong irrational fears of certain objects or situations
-   Characterised by the avoidance of a particular stimulus
-   Impact on an individual's life depends on the stimulus and the frequency of exposure

#### Proposed Causal Factors for Anxiety Disorders

-   Biological: genetics, over active autonomic nervous system.
-   Psychological: Anxiety as a learned response
-   Sociocultural: culturally bound anxieties such as taijin kyofusho. <span>Taijin kyofusho</span> is characterised by an intense fear that one's body parts or functions displease, embarrass or are offensive to others.

### LO4: Provide an overview of the somatic symptom and dissociative disorders, and consider how culture influences incidence and prevalence.

Somatic symptom and related disorders involve physical complaints or disabilities that suggest a medical problem, but do not have a known biological cause and are not produced voluntarily by a person, such as:

-   Somatic Symptom Disorder.
-   Illness Anxiety Disorder.
-   Conversion Disorder (functioning neurological symptom disorder).
-   Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions.
-   Factitious Disorder (A patient intentionally falsifies medical or psychiatric symptoms.

#### Culture and Somatic Symptom Disorders

-   Incidence appears higher in groups where discussing emotions and psychological disorders are stigmatised.
-   Subgroups such as the military, police and first responders tend to have higher rates in Western cultures.
-   People from Chinese/Japanese cultures can exhibit higher somatic awareness, but lower interoceptive accuracy compared to Western cultures
-   Language and cultural practices such as yoga, tai chi and mindfulness are thought to explain these differences.

#### Dissociative Disorders

Are characterised by a disruption of and/or discontinuity in the normal integration of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, motor control and behaviour. In other words these disorders are characterised by a breakdown in the normal integration of personality traits and qualities, such examples are:

-   Dissociative Amnesia
-   Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)
-   Depersonalisation/Derealisation Disorder
  
#### Culture and Dissociative Disorders

-   Focus on the self (as with DID), which is constructed largely through our culture/s
-   Generally more common in Western cultures
-   Research into this area is still in its infancy
-   Voluntary experiences of depersonalisation/derealisation through meditation practices in some cultures
-   Some cultures can view this as an experience of possession by a spirit.

### LO5: Describe the symptoms associated with depression and bipolar disorder, and outline the typical course and causal factors.

<span>Major Depressive Disorder</span> is an intense state of dysphoria and/or lack of ability to feel positive emotion (<span>anhedonia</span>), leaving a person unable to function effectively in their life.
