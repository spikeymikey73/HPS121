### LO1: Consider how the three D’s inform our understanding of what is ‘abnormal’, and outline the diagnostic manuals used to classify and categorise psychological disorders.

#### <span><span>What is abnormal?</span>

Abnormal behaviour is behaviour that is personally distressing, personally dysfunctional, and/or so culturally deviant that other people judge it to be inappropriate or distressing.

#### <span>The 3Ds of Abnormality</span>

Distressing - to the individuals and/or people around them.
Dysfunctional - to the individual and/or society in some way.
Deviant - Significantly differs from societal norms and/or is out of situational context.

For example, homosexuality was considered abnormal behaviour and outside of societal norms until 1973, and was subsequently removed from the DSM in 1987.

#### <span>Diagnostic Manuals</span>

<span>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)</span>

  -   Main publication manual
  -   Revised every 2 - 3 years
  -   Most commonly used within Australia
  -   Published (and updated) by the American Psychological Association

<span>International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD10)</span>

  -   Published by World Health Organisation

### LO2: Describe the vulnerability-stress model and how it assists in explaining the development of behavioural disorders.

#### <span>The Vulnerability-Stress Model</span>

-   Also known as the <span>Diathesis-Stress Model</span>
-   The culmination of vulnerability (<span>predisposing</span> factors) and stress (<span>precipitating</span> factors) that lead to a Mental Health Disorder.
-   As described in the "Stress Bucket" video
-   The bucket represents our capacity to cope with stress
-   The events in our life add or remove water from the bucket

### LO3: Understand the key characteristics of the anxiety and related disorders, and explain the underlying causal factors.

#### <span>Anxiety and Related Disorders</span>

Are characterised by a subjective experience of fear and worry, physiological arousal, and a behavioural tendency to escape or avoid a feared situation

#### <span>What Makes It Abnormal?</span>

<span>Anxiety</span> - A natural response to a perceived threat.

<span>Anxiety Disorder</span> - The intensity or frequency of an individual's anxiety response that is out of proportion to the situation.

Anxiety itself stems from an evolutionary perspective and the potential threat to our safety from our environment (e.g. animals), however, observable changes to our society have altered the nature and frequency of external threats.

#### <span>Anxiety Disorder Examples</span>

-   Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
-   Generalised Anxiety Disorder
-   Panic Disorder
-   Social Anxiety Disorder
-   Specific Phobias

#### <span>Generalised Anxiety Disorder</span>

-   Chronic state of diffuse anxiety that is not attached to specific situations or objects.
-   Lasting at least 6 months.

#### <span>Phobias</span>

-   Strong irrational fears of certain objects or situations
-   Characterised by the avoidance of a particular stimulus
-   Impact on an individual's life depends on the stimulus and the frequency of exposure

#### <span>Proposed Causal Factors for Anxiety Disorders</span>

-   Biological: genetics, over active autonomic nervous system.
-   Psychological: Anxiety as a learned response
-   Sociocultural: culturally bound anxieties such as taijin kyofusho. <span>Taijin kyofusho</span> is characterised by an intense fear that one's body parts or functions displease, embarrass or are offensive to others.

### LO4: Provide an overview of the somatic symptom and dissociative disorders, and consider how culture influences incidence and prevalence.

Somatic symptom and related disorders involve physical complaints or disabilities that suggest a medical problem, but do not have a known biological cause and are not produced voluntarily by a person, such as:

-   Somatic Symptom Disorder.
-   Illness Anxiety Disorder.
-   Conversion Disorder (functioning neurological symptom disorder).
-   Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions.
-   Factitious Disorder (A patient intentionally falsifies medical or psychiatric symptoms.

#### <span>Culture and Somatic Symptom Disorders</span>

-   Incidence appears higher in groups where discussing emotions and psychological disorders are stigmatised.
-   Subgroups such as the military, police and first responders tend to have higher rates in Western cultures.
-   People from Chinese/Japanese cultures can exhibit higher somatic awareness, but lower interoceptive accuracy compared to Western cultures
-   Language and cultural practices such as yoga, tai chi and mindfulness are thought to explain these differences.

#### <span>Dissociative Disorders</span>

Are characterised by a disruption of and/or discontinuity in the normal integration of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, motor control and behaviour. In other words these disorders are characterised by a breakdown in the normal integration of personality traits and qualities, such examples are:

-   Dissociative Amnesia
-   Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)
-   Depersonalisation/Derealisation Disorder
  
#### <span>Culture and Dissociative Disorders</span>

-   Focus on the self (as with DID), which is constructed largely through our culture/s
-   Generally more common in Western cultures
-   Research into this area is still in its infancy
-   Voluntary experiences of depersonalisation/derealisation through meditation practices in some cultures
-   Some cultures can view this as an experience of possession by a spirit.

### LO5: Describe the symptoms associated with depression and bipolar disorder, and outline the typical course and causal factors.

<span>Major Depressive Disorder</span> is an intense state of dysphoria and/or lack of ability to feel positive emotion (<span>anhedonia</span>), leaving a person unable to function effectively in their life.

#### <span>Course of MDD</span>

-   Can appear at any age, most commonly in 20s
-   Highly variable course; some people do not experience remission, while others have long periods between episodes
-   Recovery often starts within three months of symptom onset for every 2 in 5 people and within a year for 4 to 5 people.

#### <span>Proposed Causal Factors for MDD</span>

-   Biological: genetics, low levels of norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin.
-   Psychological: negative self beliefs, low self esteem and learned helplessness.
-   Environmental: adverse childhood events.

<span>Bipolar Disorders</span> involve alternating periods of depressive and manic states.

#### <span>Bipolar Subtypes</span>

| Bipolar I Disorder                                                                                                                | Bipolar II Disorder                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Involves experiences of depression that alternate with periods of <span>mania</span> (highly excited state of mood and behaviour) | Involves experiences of depression that alternate with periods of <span>hypomania</span> (similar symptoms to mania, but less severe) |

#### <span>Course of Bipolar Disorders</span>

##### <span>Bipolar I</span>

-   Mean age onset of 18 years
-   \>90% of people who have a single manic episode experience recurrent mood episodes.

##### <span>Bipolar II</span>

-   Mean age onset in early 20s.
-   Generally begins with depressive episode(s)
-   Lower number of depressive episodes across the lifespan than Bipolar I
-   Time between mood episodes tends to lessen with age.
-   Depressive moods are more chronic and intense

#### <span>Proposed causal factors for Bipolar Disorders</span>

-   Biological: Approximately 10 times higher risk among relatives of people with BI or BII as a result of overactive BAS (Behavioural Activation System)
-   Psychological: cognitive styles involving high autonomy, high standards, and strong self criticism predicted hypomanic/manic states.

### LO6: Provide an explanation of the characteristics and sub-types relating to schizophrenia and the associated causes.

<span>Schizophrenia</span> involves a constellation of cognitive, behavioural and emotional dysfunctions associated with impaired occupational and social functioning.

#### <span>Schizophrenia Sub-Types</span>

<span>According to the DSM-IV:</span>

-   Paranoid
-   Disorganised
-   Catatonic
-   Undifferentiated (mixed symptoms of 2 or more sub-types)
-   Residual

#### <span>Removal of Sub-Types from DSM-V</span>

##### <span><span>Rationale</span>

-   Presentation of sub-types overlapped
-   Sub-types did not remain stable over time
-   Did not predict course of disorder
-   Cluster analyses showed patients could not be accurately categorised into sub-types based on symptoms

##### <span>Outcome</span>
In the DSM-IV, the sub-types are now listed as optional specifiers or extensions to the diagnosis that offer more clarity to the clinician (more than one can be applied).

#### <span>Proposed Causal Factors for Schizophrenis</span>

-   Environmental: Stressors
-   Biological: genetic combination of <abbr title="The basic components of a gene">alleles</abbr>, structural abnormalities in the brain, over production of dopamine
-   Social: socioeconomic status.

More research is required on this disorder, and all causal factors are not yet identified.

### LO7: Explain the characteristics and causes of personality disorders, and consider the dimensional approach to diagnosis.

A <span>personality disorder</span> is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behaviour that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment.

#### <span>Proposed Causal Factors for Personality Disorders</span>

##### <span>Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD)</span>

-   Biological: genetic predisposition, differences in brain structure
-   Psychological: maladaptive learning

##### <span>Borderline Personality Disorder</span>
-   Biological: genetic predisposition
-   Environmental: early trauma, rejection, abandonment

#### <span>Dimensional Approach to Diagnosis</span>

-   As opposed to a categorical approach (either present or not present), the dimensional approach is based on the premise that behaviours, emotions and cognitions are rated on a continuum of severity.
-   In the context of personality disorders, these are the main facets considered:
    +   Disturbances in the self
    +   Disturbances in interpersonal functioning
    +   Five broad personality domains
-   Personality disorders are then considered as the extent to which an individual demonstrates the two main facets and trait domains.

### LO8: Describe the childhood neurodevelopmental disorders and underlying causal factors associated with each.

<span>Neurodevelopmental Disorders</span> are characterised by neurodevelopmental deficits that are known to always manifest at an early age, usually before or just after the child enters school, and interfere with the child's personal, social, or academic functioning.

##### <span>Examples of Neurodevelopmental Disorders</span>

-   Intellectual Development Disorder
-   Communication Disorders
-   Neurodevelopmental Motor Disorders
-   Specific Learning Disorders
-   Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
-   Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

#### <span>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</span>

Involves two main domains:

-   Difficulties in social interactions
-   A pattern of repetitive behaviours, interests and activities

##### <span>Proposed Causal Factors for ASD</span>

-   Biological: genetics, anomalies in brain structure and functioning
-   Psychological: <abbr title="The understanding that others have unique beliefs and desires that are different from our own, helping us attribute these characteristics to others.">Theory of Mind</abbr>
-   There is no link between vaccinations and autism.

#### <span>Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</span>

-   Defined by impairing of skills such as inattention, disorganisation, and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity.
-   Causal factors are largely unknown, but are thought to be affected by genetic and environmental factors.

### LO9: Critically evaluate the consequences of diagnostic labelling for the people that receive them, and consider the potential personal, social and legal consequences.

#### <span>Diagnostic Labels</span>

-   An assumption that all people with a particular disorder are largely the same in the underlying character of a disorder.
-   Diagnostic labels serve multiple purposes:
    -   Allowing clinicians to process a lot of information
    -   Making it easier to communicate about patients (describing symptoms and prognosis, as well as <abbr title="the cause, set of causes or manner of causation of a disease or condition">aetiology</abbr> and treatment)

#### <span>Social and Personal Consequences</span>

-   Can be difficult to separate the person and their behaviour
-   May stick even after the person is no longer affected by the disorder
-   Self-fulfilling prophecy (adopting behaviours attributed to a disorder that may not already be exhibited).
-   Stigma, shame or guilt that may prevent a patient from seeking treatmentor resolution.

#### <span>Legal Consequences</span>

-   Involuntary hospitalisation
-   If accused of a crime, the defendant may be deemed "not competent to stand trial" and hospitalised until deemed competent.
-   Deemed as "defensive mental impairment" (Australian version of "not guilty by reason of insanity")
