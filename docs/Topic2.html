<h2 class="tabset">The Psychodynamic Perspective</h2>
<ul>
<li>Psychodynamic perspective is a psychological approach that
originated from the work of Sigmund Freud.</li>
<li>It focuses on unconscious processes and the impact of childhood
experiences on the development of adult personality.</li>
<li>It has evolved over time and now includes theories like object
relations and neuropsychoanalysis.</li>
<li>While some psychodynamic concepts have been supported by empirical
evidence, others are still controversial and the approach continues to
influence various areas of modern psychology.</li>
</ul>
<div id="introduction" class="section level3">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>The psychodynamic perspective on personality, originated from the
work of Sigmund Freud, emphasizes unconscious psychological processes
(such as wishes and fears) and the impact of childhood experiences on
adult personality.</li>
<li>This perspective has been both influential and controversial, with
some of its concepts being supported by empirical evidence while others
are not.</li>
<li>The psychodynamic theory continues to play an important role in
psychology and many related disciplines, such as developmental
psychology, social psychology, sociology, and neuroscience.</li>
<li>The theory has evolved over time and now includes innovative
approaches such as object relations theory and neuropsychoanalysis.</li>
<li>In the context of personality, psychodynamic theory can help one
understand why they may do things that don’t make sense, by exploring
unconscious thoughts and emotions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="core-assumptions-of-the-psychodynamic-perspective"
class="section level3">
<h3>Core Assumptions of the Psychodynamic Perspective</h3>
<p>The core assumptions of the psychodynamic framework are unique from
the componenets of other personality ideas.</p>
</div>
<div id="primacy-of-the-unconscious" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Primacy of the Unconscious</h3>
<ul>
<li>The perspective on unconscious psychological processes is a central
aspect of psychodynamic theory.</li>
<li>The idea is that unconscious thoughts, feelings, and impulses
influence our behaviour, even though we may not be aware of them.</li>
<li>For example, a person may have unconscious fears or desires that
drive their behaviour, even if they don’t consciously understand what is
motivating them.</li>
<li>Psychoanalytic therapy aims to bring these unconscious processes to
consciousness, where they can be better understood and addressed.</li>
<li>The belief in the importance of unconscious psychological processes
continues to be a defining feature of the psychodynamic perspective on
personality.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="critical-importance-of-early-experiences"
class="section level3">
<h3>2. Critical Importance of Early Experiences</h3>
<ul>
<li>The psychodynamic theory holds that childhood experiences and
unconscious psychological processes play a crucial role in shaping adult
personality.</li>
<li>According to this perspective, early childhood experiences,
including even those that occur in the first few weeks or months of
life, can have a lasting impact on a person’s personality development
and dynamics.</li>
<li>The emphasis on early childhood events sets the psychodynamic theory
apart from other models of personality development, which also consider
early experiences but do not place as much emphasis on their
impact.</li>
<li>The theory also posits that experiences outside the normal range,
such as the loss of a parent or sibling at an early age, can have a
particularly strong impact on personality development.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="psychic-causality" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Psychic Causality</h3>
<ul>
<li>The third core assumption of psychodynamic theory is that nothing in
mental life happens by chance—that there is no such thing as a random
thought, feeling, motive, or behaviour.</li>
<li>This has come to be known as the <em>principle of psychic
causality</em>, and though few psychologists accept the principle of
psychic causality precisely as psychoanalysts conceive it, most
theorists and researchers agree that thoughts, motives, emotional
responses, and expressed behaviours do not arise randomly, but always
stem from some combination of identifiable biological and psychological
processes (Elliott, 2002; Robinson &amp; Gordon, 2011).</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-evolution-of-psychodynamic-theory" class="section level2">
<h2>The Evolution of Psychodynamic Theory</h2>
<ul>
<li>Freud’s background in neurology is the basis for the first
incarnation of psychoanalytic theory being regarded as primarily
biological.</li>
<li>Freud set out to explain psychological phenomena in terms that could
be linked to neurological functioning as it was understood in his
day.</li>
<li>Because Freud’s work in this area evolved over more than 50 years
(he began in 1885, and continued until he died in 1939), there were
numerous revisions along the way.</li>
<li>Thus, it is most accurate to think of psychodynamic theory as a set
of interrelated models that complement and build upon each other.</li>
<li>Three are particularly important: the topographic model, the
psychosexual stage model, and the structural model.</li>
</ul>
<div id="the-topographic-model" class="section level3">
<h3>The Topographic Model</h3>
<ul>
<li>The topographic model describes the unconscious, preconscious, and
conscious as different regions of the mind.</li>
<li>The unconscious is seen as the largest (and most primitive, and
controversial) part of the psyche, contains all the instinctual drives,
repressed material, and anxiety-producing material (such as sexual
impulses and aggressive urges) that are deliberately repressed, meaning
they are kept outside of conscious awareness as a form of self-defence
because they make you uncomfortable.</li>
<li>The preconscious is a more advanced part of the mind, which contains
thoughts and feelings that are not currently in conscious awareness but
can be brought to consciousness if needed.</li>
<li>The conscious is the smallest part of the mind and contains all the
thoughts, feelings, and experiences that are currently in
awareness.</li>
<li>The idea of the unconscious mind continues to be debated in
psychology, with some researchers finding evidence for its existence and
others believing that unconscious processing can be explained without
it.</li>
<li>The terms conscious, preconscious, and unconscious continue to be
used today and research has provided some support for Freud’s thoughts
regarding conscious and preconscious processing.</li>
<li>However, the idea of a Freudian unconscious repository of repressed
wishes and impulses remains controversial.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-psychosexual-stage-model" class="section level3">
<h3>The Psychosexual Stage Model</h3>
<ul>
<li>The psychosexual stage model proposed by Freud in 1905 argues that
human personality development progresses through a sequence of stages
(driven by sexual and aggressive energy (libido)), each with its own
unique challenge and mode of sexual gratification from infancy to
adulthood.</li>
<li>The stages are oral, anal, Oedipal, latency, and genital. Fixation
at a particular stage due to frustration or over gratification is
thought to result in a dependent (oral), controlling (anal), or
aggressive/competitive (Oedipal) personality style.</li>
<li>Each stage is marked by the appearance of a new erogenous zone (an
area of the body that is particularly sensitive to sexual stimulation)
and is associated with a specific conflict that must be resolved.</li>
<li>According to the model, if the individual experiences trauma or
fixates at any of the stages, this can result in the development of
certain personality traits and psychological disorders.</li>
<li>The psychosexual stage model and its relationship to personality
development remain a significant part of psychoanalytic theory.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-structural-model" class="section level3">
<h3>The Structural Model</h3>
<ul>
<li>The structural model describes the psyche as consisting of three
parts: the id, the ego, and the superego.</li>
<li>The id is the unconscious part of the psyche that is driven by
instinctual drives and impulses.</li>
<li>The ego is the conscious part of the psyche that mediates between
the impulses of the id and the demands of reality.</li>
<li>The superego is the moral component of the psyche, which
internalizes the values and norms of society and provides a sense of
right and wrong.</li>
<li>According to the structural model, the dynamic interplay between the
id, ego, and superego results in the development of the individual’s
personality and behaviour.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-ego-and-its-defences" class="section level3">
<h3>The Ego and its Defences</h3>
<p>Common Ego Defences in Psychodynamic Theory</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Repression</em>: The unconscious removal of upsetting thoughts
and feelings from conscious awareness. Example: A person blocks out
memories of childhood abuse.</li>
<li><em>Denial</em>: The conscious ignoring the implications of a
painful event. Example: A person with a substance abuse problem says
“I’m fine—even though people complain about my drinking, I never miss a
day of work.”</li>
<li><em>Projection</em>: Attributing one’s own unacceptable thoughts or
feelings to others. Example: A person who has aggressive impulses
accuses others of being hostile.</li>
<li><em>Displacement</em>: Shifting one’s emotional responses from a
threatening target to a less threatening substitute. Example: A person
who is angry with their boss takes out their frustration on their
spouse.</li>
<li><em>Regression</em>: Reverting to an earlier stage of development in
response to stress. Example: An adult who is feeling overwhelmed may
start sucking their thumb.</li>
<li><em>Rationalization</em>: Offering self-justifying explanations in
place of the real reasons for one’s behavior. Example: A person who was
fired for poor performance says that the job wasn’t a good fit for them
anyway.</li>
<li><em>Sublimation</em>: Channelling unacceptable impulses into
socially acceptable behavior. Example: A person who has aggressive
impulses becomes a professional boxer.</li>
<li>These are just a few of the many ego defenses that have been
identified in psychodynamic theory. The use of these defences is seen as
a way for the ego to manage anxiety and protect itself from stress, but
at the same time, they can also lead to the distorting of reality and
the perpetuation of problematic behavior patterns.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="psychodynamic-theories-where-are-we-now"
class="section level2">
<h2>Psychodynamic Theories: Where Are We Now?</h2>
<p>Empirical Testing of Psychodynamic Concepts: Research has been
conducted to empirically test psychodynamic concepts and theories, such
as the concept of transference, the role of unconscious processes in
personality, and the effects of childhood experiences on adult behavior.
This research has provided some support for psychodynamic concepts, but
it has also led to modifications and revisions of these concepts.</p>
<p>Psychoanalysis and Culture: The influence of culture on
psychoanalytic theory has been recognized and studied. Cultural values,
beliefs and norms can shape the way psychoanalytic concepts are
understood and applied.</p>
<p>Neuroscience and Psychodynamics: Advances in neuroimaging and
neuropsychology have opened up new opportunities to explore the
relationship between brain and behavior, and the role of unconscious
mental processes in personality. However, the relationship between
psychodynamics and neuroscience is still being explored, and the field
continues to face challenges in integrating these two perspectives.</p>
<div
id="object-relations-theory-and-the-growth-of-the-psychodynamic-perspective"
class="section level3">
<h3>Object Relations Theory and the Growth of the Psychodynamic
Perspective</h3>
<ul>
<li>This perspective focuses on the role of early childhood
relationships in shaping personality and shaping adult relationships. It
emphasizes the importance of the child’s experience of being loved,
understood and emotionally connected to important caretakers.</li>
<li>According to this theory, a child’s relationship with his or her
parents is crucial to the formation of self-esteem and the capacity for
healthy relationships in adulthood.</li>
<li>The child’s interactions with his or her parents and other
significant figures are seen as the building blocks of the child’s inner
world, including mental representations of self and others, as well as
unconscious fantasies, desires, and anxieties.</li>
<li>Also emphasizes the importance of the interpersonal context in
shaping personality development. This means that relationships, rather
than individual factors, are seen as the key drivers of personality
development and change.</li>
<li>Overall, object relations theory offers a nuanced and sophisticated
perspective on the development of personality, recognizing the
importance of both early childhood experiences and ongoing relationships
in shaping the self and personality.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Empirical Research on Psychodynamic Theories</h3>
<ul>
<li>Research has been conducted to empirically test psychodynamic
concepts and theories, such as the concept of transference, the role of
unconscious processes in personality, and the effects of childhood
experiences on adult behavior.</li>
<li>This research has provided some support for psychodynamic concepts,
but it has also led to modifications and revisions of these
concepts.</li>
<li>Psychoanalysis and culture is another growing area of interest in
contemporary psychodynamic theory.</li>
<li>Psychoanalysis has always been concerned with the role of culture in
shaping personality, but it has historically focused on the influence of
the cultural forces (such as media, religion, politics, and economics)
that shape our unconscious desires and conflicts.</li>
<li>Today, psychoanalytic research also considers the ways in which
culture shapes the way we understand and treat mental illness.</li>
<li>In particular, researchers are exploring how cultural and ethnic
differences affect the way people experience and express emotions,
relationships, and psychological distress.</li>
<li>Advances in neuroscience have created new opportunities and
challenges for psychodynamic theory. The increasing ability to measure
brain activity has created the possibility of gaining new insights into
unconscious mental processes, including the workings of the ego, the id,
and the superego. However, neuroscience has also created challenges for
psychodynamic theory, because it has revealed that some traditional
psychoanalytic concepts, such as the notion that the unconscious is
inaccessible to conscious awareness, may be too simplistic (Kihlstrom,
2010). Nonetheless, the integration of psychodynamic theory with
neuroscience has the potential to advance our understanding of mental
processes, personality development, and the treatment of psychological
disorders.</li>

<h3 class="unnumbered">Looking Ahead: Psychodynamic Theory in the 21st
Century (and Beyond)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The psychodynamic perspective has been a major force in psychology
for more than a century and has had a lasting impact on the field.</li>
<li>Despite criticism and controversy, the psychodynamic perspective has
been able to evolve and adapt to new ideas, findings, and social
forces.</li>
<li>The theory continues to be relevant in addressing a wide range of
topics such as normal and pathological functioning, motivation and
emotion, childhood and adulthood, individual and culture.</li>
<li>The integration of psychodynamic concepts with findings from
neuroscience has also led to the development of neuropsychoanalysis,
which has further expanded our understanding of human behavior and

<h2 class="tabset">Personality Traits</h2>
<div id="introduction-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>The trait approach to personality psychology aims to understand
individual differences in personality by focusing on personality traits,
which are basic dimensions along which people differ.</li>
<li>Traits are thought to be consistent, stable, and reflective of
individual differences.</li>
<li>Gordon Allport and Henry Odbert’s lexical hypothesis guided their
approach to finding the major traits by searching dictionaries for
personality descriptors and using statistical techniques to determine
which words went together.</li>
<li>The goal was to identify the basic dimensions underlying the many
words we use to describe people and reduce the number of traits.</li>
<li>The trait approach has been successful in identifying the
five-factor model or the “big five” traits:
<ul>
<li>Extroversion,</li>
<li>Conscientiousness,</li>
<li>Agreeableness,</li>
<li>Neuroticism, and</li>
<li>Openness to Experience.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-five-factor-model-of-personality" class="section level3">
<h3>The Five-Factor Model of Personality</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Big Five or Five-Factor Model of personality is the most widely
accepted system for describing personality traits.</li>
<li>The five traits are Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion,
Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (OCEAN).</li>
<li>These traits describe stable patterns of behavior that persist over
long periods of time and have broad-ranging consequences for various
areas of life.</li>
<li>For instance, Conscientiousness has been found to predict success in
college, job performance, and health.</li>
<li>There is growing interest in personality psychology among
psychologists who work in applied settings like health psychology and
organizational psychology.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="facets-of-traits-subtraits" class="section level3">
<h3>Facets of Traits (Subtraits)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Big Five traits are a widely accepted framework for summarizing
a person’s personality.</li>
<li>They are, however, considered broad and do not capture the
complexity and specificity of an individual’s behavior and
thoughts.</li>
<li>To address this, lower-level units of personality known as facets
have been proposed.</li>
<li>Facets provide more specific descriptions of a person’s
characteristics and are useful in providing a more nuanced understanding
of an individual’s personality.</li>
<li>Different facets within a trait tend to go together and can be used
to predict how a person might behave in different situations.</li>
<li>The list of facets is not universally accepted, and different
researchers may propose different lists. Nevertheless, facets provide
valuable information and add to our understanding of a person’s
personality beyond just their Big Five trait scores.</li>

<h3>Other Traits Beyond the Five-Factor Model</h3>
<p>-Not all researchers agree on the number and composition of
personality traits, and there have been other models proposed with
different traits. - For example, Hans Eysenck proposed that Extraversion
and Neuroticism are the two most important traits and linked them to
differences in people’s biology. - The HEXACO model adds
Honesty-Humility as a sixth dimension of personality. - Despite the
popularity of the Big Five, there are still debates on the exact number
and composition of the traits that are most important in understanding
personality. - Additionally, there are many other traits that have been
studied by researchers in the field of personality psychology that are
not included in comprehensive models like the Big Five.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered">The Person-Situation Debate and Alternatives to
the Trait Perspective</h3>
<ul>
<li>The person-situation debate in personality psychology arose from the
publication of Walter Mischel’s book “Personality and Assessment” in
1968.</li>
<li>Mischel challenged the traditional trait perspective of personality
by suggesting that people’s behavior is not consistently consistent
across different situations.</li>
<li>He believed that psychologists should focus on people’s unique
reactions to specific situations rather than studying broad,
context-free traits.</li>
<li>Subsequent research to address this theory showed that on average,
the effect of the situation is about as large as that of personality
traits.</li>
<li>Personality traits still provide an indication of how people will
act on average, but they are not always good predictors of specific
behavior in a given situation.</li>
<li>Most modern personality researchers acknowledge the value of both
broad personality traits and narrower units studied by Mischel.</li>

<div id="introduction-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>The study of personality is diverse and encompasses a broad range of
traits and characteristics.</li>
<li>Different theoretical models have led to different approaches for
measuring these characteristics.</li>
<li><em>Humanistic</em> models focus on individuals’ goals and
motivations, so asking them directly is a good approach.</li>
<li><em>Psychodynamic</em> models suggest that unconscious processes
drive behaviour, so researchers adopt indirect approaches to identify
these factors.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="objective-tests" class="section level3">
<h3>Objective Tests</h3>
<div id="definition" class="section level4">
<h4>Definition</h4>
<ul>
<li>Objective tests have several advantages in personality assessment:
<ul>
<li>Relatively inexpensive and easy to administer,</li>
<li>Can be administered to large groups of people, and</li>
<li>Are usually highly reliable (i.e., they provide consistent scores
over time).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, objective tests have certain limitations as well:
<ul>
<li>Limited in their ability to capture the complexity of individual
differences,</li>
<li>May not always provide a complete picture of an individual’s
personality,</li>
<li>Can be affected by social desirability bias (where people tend to
respond in a way that they believe is socially desirable or acceptable),
rather than providing a true representation of their personality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Despite these limitations, objective tests continue to be widely
used in personality assessment due to their ease of use, reliability,
and versatility.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="basic-types-of-objective-tests" class="section level3">
<h3>Basic Types of Objective Tests</h3>
<div id="self-report-measures" class="section level4">
<h4>Self-Report Measures</h4>
<ul>
<li>Objective personality tests are widely used to assess personality,
and can be self-administered or performed by a psychologist.</li>
<li>Self-report tests, in which individuals describe themselves, are the
most widely used type of objective test.</li>
<li>They offer advantages such as:
<ul>
<li>cost-effectiveness, and</li>
<li>simplicity and access to a wealth of information.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Self-reported personality has been shown to have significant
validity in relation to various important outcomes, such as academic and
job performance, occupational attainment, divorce, and mortality, as
well as links to psychopathology.</li>
<li>Self-reported personality, however, is limited by:
<ul>
<li>The possibility of socially desirable responding,</li>
<li>Self-enhancement bias, and</li>
<li>The reference group effect.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="informant-ratings" class="section level4">
<h4>Informant Ratings</h4>
<ul>
<li>Informant personality ratings are a method of assessing someone’s
personality where the information is gathered from a person who knows
the person being rated well, such as a parent, teacher, spouse, friend,
or boss.</li>
<li>These ratings are particularly useful when self-ratings are not
possible or not reliable.</li>
<li>Informant ratings offer advantages such as:
<ul>
<li>Being based on the informant’s observation of the person’s
behaviour, and</li>
<li>Being less likely to be distorted by defensiveness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Informant ratings can also be limited by:
<ul>
<li>The amount of information the informant has about the person,
and</li>
<li>Are subject to response biases (the reference group effect, and the
tendency for informants to produce overly favourable ratings).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="other-ways-of-classifying-objective-tests"
class="section level3">
<h3>Other Ways of Classifying Objective Tests</h3>
<ul>
<li>Personality tests differ on two dimensions:
<ul>
<li><em>Comprehensiveness</em> (measure a single attribute (e.g. Toronto
Alexithymia Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), and</li>
<li><em>Breadth of the target characteristics</em> (e.g. California
Psychological Inventory, HEXACO Personality Inventory, Multidimensional
Personality Questionnaire, NEO Personality Inventory-3, Personality
Research Form, 16PF).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are different levels of breadth or generality at which
personality characteristics can be classified.</li>
<li>Some models emphasize broad, “big” traits, while others focus on
more specific characteristics.</li>
<li>Some popular personality instruments assess only broad traits, while
others assess a large number of more specific characteristics.</li>
<li>Some instruments are explicitly designed to provide coverage of both
general and specific trait characteristics.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="projective-and-implicit-tests" class="section level3">
<h3>Projective and Implicit Tests</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Projective</em> tests are based on the belief that
unconscious needs, feelings, and experiences can be revealed by having
people describe or interpret ambiguous stimuli.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of projective tests include the Rorschach Inkblot Test
and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT).</p></li>
<li><p>Projective tests can be cumbersome to administer and score, but
they can provide information about implicit motives that is not easily
obtained from objective measures.</p></li>
<li><p>The TAT has shown significant validity in measuring the need for
achievement, while the validity of the Rorschach has been a matter of
controversy.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Implicit</em> measures of personality are based on the idea
that people form automatic or implicit associations between certain
concepts based on their previous experience and behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p>These measures assess the strength of associations between
concepts and can be used to predict behavior, even after controlling for
scores on objective measures of personality.</p></li>
<li><p>While validity evidence for these measures is still limited, the
results to date are promising.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="behavioral-and-performance-measures" class="section level3">
<h3>Behavioral and Performance Measures</h3>
<ul>
<li>Behavioural measures of personality involve directly observing and
measuring people’s behaviour in natural settings.</li>
<li>This approach offers several advantages, such as avoiding response
biases and studying people in their daily lives.</li>
<li>However, it is more labour-intensive than other methods and
generates a large set of data that must be scored reliably.</li>
<li>Also, the small samples of behavior collected may not reflect a
person’s true characteristics accurately, as they can be influenced by
transient factors such as a participant’s level of stress, and their
quality of sleep the previous night.</li>
