<div id="the-psychodynamic-perspective" class="section level2">
<h2>The Psychodynamic Perspective</h2>
<ul>
<li>Psychodynamic perspective is a psychological approach that
originated from the work of Sigmund Freud.</li>
<li>It focuses on unconscious processes and the impact of childhood
experiences on the development of adult personality.</li>
<li>It has evolved over time and now includes theories like object
relations and neuropsychoanalysis.</li>
<li>While some psychodynamic concepts have been supported by empirical
evidence, others are still controversial and the approach continues to
influence various areas of modern psychology.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li>The psychodynamic perspective on personality, originated from the
work of Sigmund Freud, emphasizes unconscious psychological processes
(such as wishes and fears) and the impact of childhood experiences on
adult personality.</li>
<li>This perspective has been both influential and controversial, with
some of its concepts being supported by empirical evidence while others
are not.</li>
<li>The psychodynamic theory continues to play an important role in
psychology and many related disciplines, such as developmental
psychology, social psychology, sociology, and neuroscience.</li>
<li>The theory has evolved over time and now includes innovative
approaches such as object relations theory and neuropsychoanalysis.</li>
<li>In the context of personality, psychodynamic theory can help one
understand why they may do things that don’t make sense, by exploring
unconscious thoughts and emotions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="core-assumptions-of-the-psychodynamic-perspective"
class="section level2 tabset">
<h2 class="tabset">Core Assumptions of the Psychodynamic
Perspective</h2>
<p>The core assumptions of the psychodynamic framework are unique from
the componenets of other personality ideas.</p>
<div id="primacy-of-the-unconscious" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Primacy of the Unconscious</h3>
<ul>
<li>The perspective on unconscious psychological processes is a central
aspect of psychodynamic theory.</li>
<li>The idea is that unconscious thoughts, feelings, and impulses
influence our behaviour, even though we may not be aware of them.</li>
<li>For example, a person may have unconscious fears or desires that
drive their behaviour, even if they don’t consciously understand what is
motivating them.</li>
<li>Psychoanalytic therapy aims to bring these unconscious processes to
consciousness, where they can be better understood and addressed.</li>
<li>The belief in the importance of unconscious psychological processes
continues to be a defining feature of the psychodynamic perspective on
personality.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="critical-importance-of-early-experiences"
class="section level3">
<h3>2. Critical Importance of Early Experiences</h3>
<ul>
<li>The psychodynamic theory holds that childhood experiences and
unconscious psychological processes play a crucial role in shaping adult
personality.</li>
<li>According to this perspective, early childhood experiences,
including even those that occur in the first few weeks or months of
life, can have a lasting impact on a person’s personality development
and dynamics.</li>
<li>The emphasis on early childhood events sets the psychodynamic theory
apart from other models of personality development, which also consider
early experiences but do not place as much emphasis on their
impact.</li>
<li>The theory also posits that experiences outside the normal range,
such as the loss of a parent or sibling at an early age, can have a
particularly strong impact on personality development.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="psychic-causality" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">3. Psychic Causality</h3>
<ul>
<li>The third core assumption of psychodynamic theory is that nothing in
mental life happens by chance—that there is no such thing as a random
thought, feeling, motive, or behaviour.</li>
<li>This has come to be known as the <em>principle of psychic
causality</em>, and though few psychologists accept the principle of
psychic causality precisely as psychoanalysts conceive it, most
theorists and researchers agree that thoughts, motives, emotional
responses, and expressed behaviours do not arise randomly, but always
stem from some combination of identifiable biological and psychological
processes (Elliott, 2002; Robinson &amp; Gordon, 2011).</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-evolution-of-psychodynamic-theory"
class="section level2 tabset">
<h2 class="tabset">The Evolution of Psychodynamic Theory</h2>
<ul>
<li>Freud’s background in neurology is the basis for the first
incarnation of psychoanalytic theory being regarded as primarily
biological.</li>
<li>Freud set out to explain psychological phenomena in terms that could
be linked to neurological functioning as it was understood in his
day.</li>
<li>Because Freud’s work in this area evolved over more than 50 years
(he began in 1885, and continued until he died in 1939), there were
numerous revisions along the way.</li>
<li>Thus, it is most accurate to think of psychodynamic theory as a set
of interrelated models that complement and build upon each other.</li>
<li>Three are particularly important: the topographic model, the
psychosexual stage model, and the structural model.</li>
</ul>
<div id="the-topographic-model" class="section level3">
<h3>The Topographic Model</h3>
<ul>
<li>The topographic model describes the unconscious, preconscious, and
conscious as different regions of the mind.</li>
<li>The unconscious is seen as the largest (and most primitive, and
controversial) part of the psyche, contains all the instinctual drives,
repressed material, and anxiety-producing material (such as sexual
impulses and aggressive urges) that are deliberately repressed, meaning
they are kept outside of conscious awareness as a form of self-defence
because they make you uncomfortable.</li>
<li>The preconscious is a more advanced part of the mind, which contains
thoughts and feelings that are not currently in conscious awareness but
can be brought to consciousness if needed.</li>
<li>The conscious is the smallest part of the mind and contains all the
thoughts, feelings, and experiences that are currently in
awareness.</li>
<li>The idea of the unconscious mind continues to be debated in
psychology, with some researchers finding evidence for its existence and
others believing that unconscious processing can be explained without
it.</li>
<li>The terms conscious, preconscious, and unconscious continue to be
used today and research has provided some support for Freud’s thoughts
regarding conscious and preconscious processing.</li>
<li>However, the idea of a Freudian unconscious repository of repressed
wishes and impulses remains controversial.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-psychosexual-stage-model" class="section level3">
<h3>The Psychosexual Stage Model</h3>
<ul>
<li>The psychosexual stage model proposed by Freud in 1905 argues that
human personality development progresses through a sequence of stages
(driven by sexual and aggressive energy (libido)), each with its own
unique challenge and mode of sexual gratification from infancy to
adulthood.</li>
<li>The stages are oral, anal, Oedipal, latency, and genital. Fixation
at a particular stage due to frustration or over gratification is
thought to result in a dependent (oral), controlling (anal), or
aggressive/competitive (Oedipal) personality style.</li>
<li>Each stage is marked by the appearance of a new erogenous zone (an
area of the body that is particularly sensitive to sexual stimulation)
and is associated with a specific conflict that must be resolved.</li>
<li>According to the model, if the individual experiences trauma or
fixates at any of the stages, this can result in the development of
certain personality traits and psychological disorders.</li>
<li>The psychosexual stage model and its relationship to personality
development remain a significant part of psychoanalytic theory.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-structural-model" class="section level3">
<h3>The Structural Model</h3>
<ul>
<li>The structural model describes the psyche as consisting of three
parts: the id, the ego, and the superego.</li>
<li>The id is the unconscious part of the psyche that is driven by
instinctual drives and impulses.</li>
<li>The ego is the conscious part of the psyche that mediates between
the impulses of the id and the demands of reality.</li>
<li>The superego is the moral component of the psyche, which
internalizes the values and norms of society and provides a sense of
right and wrong.</li>
<li>According to the structural model, the dynamic interplay between the
id, ego, and superego results in the development of the individual’s
personality and behaviour.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-ego-and-its-defences" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered">The Ego and its Defences</h3>
<p>Common Ego Defences in Psychodynamic Theory</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Repression</em>: The unconscious removal of upsetting thoughts
and feelings from conscious awareness. Example: A person blocks out
memories of childhood abuse.</li>
<li><em>Denial</em>: The conscious ignoring the implications of a
painful event. Example: A person with a substance abuse problem says
“I’m fine—even though people complain about my drinking, I never miss a
day of work.”</li>
<li><em>Projection</em>: Attributing one’s own unacceptable thoughts or
feelings to others. Example: A person who has aggressive impulses
accuses others of being hostile.</li>
<li><em>Displacement</em>: Shifting one’s emotional responses from a
threatening target to a less threatening substitute. Example: A person
who is angry with their boss takes out their frustration on their
spouse.</li>
<li><em>Regression</em>: Reverting to an earlier stage of development in
response to stress. Example: An adult who is feeling overwhelmed may
start sucking their thumb.</li>
<li><em>Rationalization</em>: Offering self-justifying explanations in
place of the real reasons for one’s behavior. Example: A person who was
fired for poor performance says that the job wasn’t a good fit for them
anyway.</li>
<li><em>Sublimation</em>: Channelling unacceptable impulses into
socially acceptable behavior. Example: A person who has aggressive
impulses becomes a professional boxer.</li>
<li>These are just a few of the many ego defenses that have been
identified in psychodynamic theory. The use of these defences is seen as
a way for the ego to manage anxiety and protect itself from stress, but
at the same time, they can also lead to the distorting of reality and
the perpetuation of problematic behavior patterns.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="tabset">Psychodynamic Theories: Where Are We Now?</h2>
<p>Empirical Testing of Psychodynamic Concepts: Research has been
conducted to empirically test psychodynamic concepts and theories, such
as the concept of transference, the role of unconscious processes in
personality, and the effects of childhood experiences on adult behavior.
This research has provided some support for psychodynamic concepts, but
it has also led to modifications and revisions of these concepts.</p>
<p>Psychoanalysis and Culture: The influence of culture on
psychoanalytic theory has been recognized and studied. Cultural values,
beliefs and norms can shape the way psychoanalytic concepts are
understood and applied.</p>
<p>Neuroscience and Psychodynamics: Advances in neuroimaging and
neuropsychology have opened up new opportunities to explore the
relationship between brain and behavior, and the role of unconscious
mental processes in personality. However, the relationship between
psychodynamics and neuroscience is still being explored, and the field
continues to face challenges in integrating these two perspectives.</p>
