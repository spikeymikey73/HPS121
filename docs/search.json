      "contents": "\nSome of the key developmental theories serve to try and explain or understand the complex processes of childhood development. Some of the key theories are:\nPsychodynamic Theory (Freud)\nPsychosocial Theory (Erik Erikson)\nBehaviourism and social learning theory\n‘Blank Slate’\nThe behavioural focus\nEnvironmentalist Determinism\nConditioning\nEthological theory\nEmphasis of behaviour in normal contexts. Key developmental concepts are ‘imprinting’ and the ‘critical period’\nThe bioecological theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1979)\nMicrosystem\nMesosystem\nExosystem\nMacrosystem\nLife course theory (Elder, 1995, 1998)\nHuman lives are situated in historical time and place\nDevelopmental studies must pay attention to the time of our lives\nHuman lives are interdependent or linked with each other\nHuman beings have the ability to make decisions and power to change their lives\nCognitive development theories\nCognitive Development Theory (Piaget, 1983)\nVygotsky’s Sociocultural theory development (Vygotsky, 1978, 1986)\nThe information processing approach (Siegler, 1996)\nExplain how Erikson’s Psychosocial theory uses crises to progress through stages (chapter 2)\nThe outline of Erikson’s developmental stages is below:\nDevelopmental Stage\nDevelopmental Crisis\nBirth - 1 year\nTrust Vs Mistrust\n1 - 3 years\nAutonomy vs Shame\n3 - 6 years\nInitiative vs Guilt\n6 years to adolescence\nIndustry vs Inferiority\nAdolescence (10 - 20 years)\nIdentity vs Identity Diffusion\nYoung Adulthood (20 - 40 years)\nIntimacy vs Isolation\nMiddle Adulthood (40 - 60 years)\nGernerativity vs Stagnation\nOld Age (60+ years)\nIntegrity vs Despair\nErikson’s theory encompassed both internal psychological factors and external social factors\nEach of the 8 stages appeared in order and built upon each other. A specific challenge or crisis was prevalent at each stage, requiring resolution in order to progress to the next stage. A failure to resolve each crisis lead to a negative impact in the resolution of crises at later stages.\nConsider each of the four core concepts of Behaviourism (chapter 2)\nExplain how Ethological theory integrates the natural environment into developmental stages (chapter 2)\nOutline each of Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems and consider how they consider change over time (chapter 2)\nDescribe the four key concepts of Life Course Theory and contrast it with the bioecological model (chapter 2)\nExplain how the biopsychosocial model uses components of the bioecological model to understand health (external reading)\nExplain how each of the three cognitive development theories differ from one another (chapter 2)\nCritically evaluate by comparing and contrasting all six developmental theories\nDescribe the three key theories of moral development (chapter 8)\n\n\n\nBriefly outline the stages of attachment and attachment types (chapter 9 – pg 128-134)\n\n\n\n",
