      "contents": "\nPsychosocial Theory (Erikson)\n8 stages of development from birth to adulthood.\nAll stages in a specific order, containing a crisis at each stage. needing resolution before the next stage.\nFailure to resolve the crisis at each stage would effect child’s development at late stages.\nDevelopmental Stage\nDevelopmental Crisis\nDescription of Crisis\nBirth - 1 year\nTrust Vs Mistrust\nDevelopment of trust as a consequence of treatment.\n1 - 3 years\nAutonomy vs Shame\nLearning to negotiate with parents to have needs and wants met. Development of a sense of independence.\n3 - 6 years\nInitiative vs Guilt\nLearning how to play with others, lead and follow, as opposed to prevention from joining in through guilt or fear.\n6 years to adolescence\nIndustry vs Inferiority\nBuilding of skills around play and obeying rules. Mastery of social skills, and self discipline. A mistrusting child will develop defeat and inferiority.\nAdolescence (10 - 20 years)\nIdentity vs Identity Diffusion\nChildren experiment with defiance and rule breaking. Also the time when a child will develop their sense of self and identity.\nYoung Adulthood (20 - 40 years)\nIntimacy vs Isolation\nA period of building long standing friendships and relationships.\nMiddle Adulthood (40 - 60 years)\nGernerativity vs Stagnation\nBecoming productive in society and setting an example for future generations. Developing interest in parenthood.\nOld Age (60+ years)\nIntegrity vs Despair\nAcknowledgement of prior achievement of the other stages and the recognition of integrity, as opposed to despair should one or more of the crises at previous stages not be resolved.\nEvaluation of Psychosocial Theory\nWhile insightful and plausible, no empirical evidence was gathered to develop theory.\nErikson worked mainly with children, so his theory was based on this experience.\nThe teen crisis was used to refer to the sensitivity of developmental meds at each stage, rather than a catastrophic event.\nEmphasises the role of psycological and social influence a development throughout a lifetime.\nBehaviourism (Learning Theories)\nWatson (1913) coined the term ‘behaviourism’, which is a theory assuming that behaviour is observable and can be traced back to other observable events. The goal of Behaviourism is to explain relationships between:\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ngraph LR\\n    A(Stimuli) --> B(Responses) --> C(Consequences)\\n\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nIdentified by many as being relevant regardless of age, and not being isolated to a particular “stage”. The focus instead, is on stimulus/response and looking for predictable patterns of behaviour.\nCore Concepts:\nThe Blank Slate: Children enter the world as a blank slate with ability to learn based on their environment.\nBehavioural Focus: Concentrates on observable behaviours, and discovery of environmental stimuli responsible.\nEnvironmental Determinism: A individuals behaviour is shaped by their environment rather than ‘free will’.\nConditioning: The main process through which we learn.\nExamples of behaviourism include: Pavlov’s dogs (Classical Conditioning), Skinner’s Pigeons (Operant Conditioning) and Bandura’s Social Modelling or Social learning theory (Bobo Doll). The observation (of consequences), imitation, and modelling as demonstrated via the Bobo doll experiment (modelling and imitation of aggression). The experiment found that observations of aggressive behaviour influenced children towards acceptance of behaviours.\nEvaluation of behavioural theories\nEmpirical approach\nAttempts to demonstrate cause and effect\nNeglects rational thought processes.\nDoes not address behaviours that are present in the absence of conditioning.\nDemonstration of hostile more likely to develop a hostile bias in future interactions.\nSome suggest that the setting is artificial. Demonstrating behaviours that were thought to be expected.\nFails to determine if behaviours would be generalised in other scenarios.\nPrimary focus on environmental factors, ignoring genetic disposition, sex based neurological differences.\nEthological Theory\nEvaluation of Ethological Theory\nEcological Theory\nStresses that behaviour is strongly influenced by biology and evolution while also being mediated by sensitive periods. Emotions and thinking is heavily influenced by inherited factors.\nCharles Darwin’s theory of evolution underpins this theory, stating that more than just physical attributes (hair and eye colour) influence us.\nEvaluation of Ecological Theory\nLife Course Theory\nEvaluation of Life Course Theory\nEnvironment\nBioecological Model\nLife Course theory\nCognitive development theories\nPiaget’s CDT\nSociocultural Theory Development (Vygotsky)\nInfo processing approach (Siegler)\n\n\n\n",
